Option #1 - Implementing SAS Hypothesis Testing
For this assignment, SAS code was given to determine if tutoring improved test scores for 12 students.  The way measurement will take place is recording test scores before tutoring and test scores after tutoring.  The statistical testing that will be used is the paired t-test, which is a two-sided test that tries to identify the difference in one sample that is higher or lower than the other sample.  Differences can also be identified as less than or greater than zero, or any other value.  In this case, we are looking for the difference in test scores before and after tutoring and what impact the tutoring had.  The null hypothesis is tutoring has no effect on test scores.
